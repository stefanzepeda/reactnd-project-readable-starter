# Grumpy Reads

This is my version of the Readable Project for Udacity. There are two components in this module, an API Server and a Front End React Redux App.

The React-Redux app is inspired in the Steemit project website, as it mirrors its skin. Additionally, fundamentals from Semantic UI for React where used across the project.

Use the top level filters to navigate through the application and buttons to vote and delete. 

The app is Grumpy Cat inspired.

## Start the project

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* Start the front end
    - `cd readable-app`
    - `npm install`
    - `yarn start`
